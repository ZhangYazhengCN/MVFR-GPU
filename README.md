## 1. Introduction

**Multi-view point cloud registration** is the basic task of point cloud processing, which needs to transform the local point clouds obtained from multiple views into a unified coordinate system. It's a key step in surface reconstruction, widely used in autonomous driving, AR/VR and other fields. 

Several computation involved in PointCloud Registration, such as **nearest neighborhood search**, **correspondence filter**, **point cloud transformation**, usually need to perform the same processing on the ***points*** in cloud. And these operations are easily implemented in parallel with the GPU, thus greatly improving the algorithm speed. However, the widely used **point cloud processing algorithm library [PCL](https://pointclouds.org/ "PCL website homepage")** only provides GPU acceleration support for [some algorithms](https://github.com/PointCloudLibrary/pcl/tree/master/gpu "PCL GPU module"), and does not realize GPU acceleration for point cloud registration. Therefore, **MVFR-GPU** expects to ***realize GPU acceleration of point cloud registration algorithm with PCL interface compatible***.

## 2. Environment

At present, MVFR-GPU is being tested on **windows** with **C++20** standard, and the details is following:

- Windows10
- Visual Studio 2022 [c++20]
- CUDA 12.6
- Eigen 3.4.0
- boost 1.86.0 [assert, preprocessor, graph]
- PCL 1.14.1 [cuda, vtk]

## 3. Experiments

### 3.1 ICPCuda experiment

Compare **ICP-GPU** with **ICP-CPU**(PCL Implementation) based on [3DMatch](https://3dmatch.cs.princeton.edu/#geometric-registration-benchmark "3DMatch Geometric Registration Benchmark"), see [ICPCuda.cpp](./examples/ICPCuda.cpp "ICPCuda Test program") for experiment code. And the comparison results of the registration time are shown in the figure below (for more detailed experimental data, see [ICP-CPU.csv](./docs/ICP-CPU.csv "ICP-CPU record file") and [ICP-GPU.csv](./docs/ICP-GPU.csv "ICP-GPU record file")):

**note:** The range of the z-axis is different between the two figures.

To repeat this experiment, please configure the 3DMatch sub-dataset according to the following structure (using **7-scenes-redkitchen** as an example):

ðŸ“¦7-scenes-redkitchen<br>
 â”£ ðŸ“‚data<br>
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œcloud_bin_0.ply<br>
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œcloud_bin_1.ply<br>
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œ...<br>
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œcloud_bin_59.ply<br>
 â”£ ðŸ“œgt.info<br>
 â”— ðŸ“œgt.log<br>

And execute the ICPCuda executable with appropriate command-line options: `./ICPCuda.exe -d DATASET_PATH`.

### 3.2 MSTRegistration experiment

**TODO**
